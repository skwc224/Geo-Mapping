# Visualizing Data with Leaflet
Visualizing the earthquake data set provided by the United States Geological Survey
- Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
- Include data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- Include a legend that provides context for the map data.
